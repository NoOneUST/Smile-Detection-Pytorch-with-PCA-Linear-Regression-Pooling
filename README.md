# Smile Detection (Pytorch)

#### This is an original and useful `smile detection` program implemented with Pytorch.

#### `AdvancedLinearRegression.py`

`AdvancedLinearRegression.py` is the main file implemented with Pytorch which you can directly run to know whether the man on a given picture is smiling or not. 

This algorithm is based on PCA & Linear Regression & Pooling. It can at least acheive ```76.35735869407654%``` accuracy on our dataset which is contructed on CelebA. 

Of course I think it is absolutely possible for you to obtain further accuracy improvement by simply adjusting the PCA coefficient or pooling size or LSR(least square regression) method.

#### `LinearRegressionOnly.py`

`LinearRegressionOnly.py` is the simplified version of `AdvancedLinearRegression.py` which is only based on linear regression. 

It will no longer be maintained thus please directly choose the above one instead of this.

No, I guess he is not smiling.
You guess correctly.
