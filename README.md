# Smile Detection (Pytorch)

#### This is an original and useful `smile detection` program implemented with Pytorch.

#### `AdvancedLinearRegression.py`

AdvancedLinearRegression.py is the main file implemented with Pytorch which you can directly run to know whether the man on a given picture is smiling or not. This algorithm is based on PCA & Linear Regression & Pooling. It can at least acheive 73.9% accuracy on our dataset which is contructed on CelebA. Of course I think it is absolutely possible for you to obtain further accuracy improvement by simply adjusting the PCA coefficient or pooling size or LSR(least square regression) method.
